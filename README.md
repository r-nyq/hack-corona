# Our goal (in draft)

```
Focused on projecting future results of Covid-19. 

	* When  will be the peak of infections be reached based on different actions taken.
	* What is the efficiency of each action? 
		And based on this, find out the best/worst cases
	* What are other important factors (like population density, .....) effect this 

We hope to be able to find the existing data to train Models that will give us this info
	make our findings easy to understand, 
	and have the results auto-update as the data changes to make it usable throughout the world
